    I am now purchasing B.E. degree of Electrical Engineering in National Cheng Kung University. I have enthusiasm for Computer Architecture, Digital Circuit Design and also take many courses related.

    In this semester, I am participating in two courses "Advanced Computing Architecture and AI Chip Design" and "VLSI Digital Circuit Design". The former introduces advance Computing System Design and topics about AI Acceleration, the latter introduces transistor-level digital circuit design, optimization techniques and EDA tools like HSPICE, Virtuoso and Laker.

    I also join extracurricular activities such as swimming team, animal welfare volunteer and free after-school tutoring for students.
